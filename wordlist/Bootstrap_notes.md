##Preface
1. Once the walls are up, we move into the __aesthetic elements__ like navbars, breadcrumbs, and media objects.
2. After that, we move on to the JavaScript elements, such as dropdowns, the __carousel__, and __modals__, that provide the interaction for a site.
3. The authors, Jacob Thornton and Mark Otto, have been __meticulous__ in providing examples of the codebase, HTML code samples, and more to kickstart your project.
##Chapter 1. Bootstrap Scaffolding
1. __Minified__ versions of the CSS and JavaScript are also included.
2. __For the sake of brevity__, I use the uncompressed version during development and then switch to the compressed version in production.
