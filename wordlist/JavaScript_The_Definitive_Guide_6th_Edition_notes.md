##CHAPTER 1 Introduction to JavaScript
1. The __overwhelming__ majority of modern websites use JavaScript, and all modern web browsers—on desktops, game consoles, tablets, and smart phones—include JavaScript interpreters, making JavaScript the most __ubiquitous__ programming language in history.
2. today’s web browsers all include web developer tools that are __indispensable__ for debugging, experimenting, and learning.
3. x = "hello world"; // Strings of text in __quotation marks__.
4. Objects are enclosed in __curly braces__.
5. The syntax illustrated above for listing array elements within __square braces__ or mapping object property names to property values inside curly braces is known as an initializer expression
6. Operator/addition/substraction/multiplication/division/equality/inequality
7. "tw" is __alphabetically greater than__ "th"
8. The other __broad__ category of statement is control structures, such as conditionals and loops.
9. Chapter 9 is really the __climax__ of Part I, and the chapters that follow wrap up some loose ends and bring our exploration of the core language to a close.
##CHAPTER 2 Lexical Structure
1. The Unicode standard defines the preferred encoding for all characters and specifies a normalization procedure to convert text to a __canonical form__ suitable for comparisons.
2. Like many programming languages, JavaScript uses the __semicolon__ (;) to separate statements (see Chapter 5) from each other.
3. If you use a nonboolean value where a boolean is expected, JavaScript will convert __accordingly__.
4. Technically, however, - is the __unary negation operator__ (see Chap- ter 4) and is not part of the numeric literal syntax.
5. These include + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplica- tion, / for division, and % for modulo (remainder after division)
6. Although it is tempting to read all three operators “equals,” it may help to reduce confusion if you read “gets or is assigned” for =, “is equal to” for ==, and “is strictly equal to” for ===.
##CHAPTER 5 Statements
1. Expressions with __side effects__, such as assignments and function invocations, can stand alone as statements, and when used this way they are known as expression state- ments.
2. Some (but not all) implementations enumerate array properties in numeric order rather than creation order, but they revert to creation order if the array is given other non-numeric properties as well or if the array is __sparse__ (i.e., if some array indexes are missing).
##CHAPTER 5 Objects
1. The ability to create a new object with an arbitrary prototype (put another way: the ability to create an __“heir”__ for any object) is a powerful one
2.
